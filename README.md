# Event Storming

The tools started as a simple command line tools using plantuml's java library to generate diagrams for Event Storming.  
To make it easier to share with the team, a web UI is developed.  
It works exactly the same way as [plantuml.com](plantuml.com) and it supports not only ```EML``` from [webeventstorming.com](webeventstorming.com) (with addition to support note/comment) but also plantuml code too.
